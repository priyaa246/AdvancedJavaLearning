/**
 * Why 2 diff streams:
 *
 * Whenever you are reading a data from a data source or writing data to the destination,
 * the data can either be simple char strings like english chars/unicode chars/it can be tabular data sitting
 * in a table in a DB/it can be XML file/It can be HTML file/it can be mathematical expression file/it can be
 * image or it can be anything. So that java creates 2 diff types of classes.

 * Why do we need Byte stream:
 * Reason: If you don't know what kind of data that the file is going to contain then use Byte stream.

 * Worth Noting: When using ByteStream, it reads the file byte by byte, one byte at a time
